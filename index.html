    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I'm Abi Turner. I currently live in Yorkshire with my partner, Kayleigh, and my dog Rupert. I'm at the start of 
        my coding journey after completing 10 years in retail management! 
    </p>
    <p>I have always had a keen interest in technology but I became interested in learning to code this year.
        After researching Software Developer careers and giving a few online resources a try, 
        I loved the challenge of learning to coding and decided to take the plunge and 
        started my coding journey at Manchester Codes Bootcamp in October 2022.</p>
